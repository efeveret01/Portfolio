                            The objective of this project was to see the viability of using neural network machine learning to make Forex Trading decisions. Results, so far (looking to improve the project as time goes on), match with reports that say the market is too unpredictable for the neural network to work.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                            The neural network is based around the one created by Daniel Shiffman. The neural network was used to master games like snake and flappy bird, so I wondered if it would be able to find a working strategy to trade on the Forex market.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                            Besides small alteration of the neural script that was designed for P5 JavaScript, there were no real challenges. The data used was scrapped from the live trading platform “MetaTrader 5” using python.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                            In the future I would look into exploring the forex data to see for further condition that can make the neural have better predictions. Also looking into trying genetic neural networking.
