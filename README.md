# Web Portfolio



## Web portfolio where projects could be displayed and easily updated to show both clients and employers my skills.

The design of the portfolio website was to be efficient, responsive, easy to navigate and easy to update projects without affecting the style of the webpage. 
As the text file gets updated with new project data in XML format, the website would be update without doing any additional coding in the future.
